**Hey! welcome**

I learned how to create a CLI app from NeoG.com.
This app shows some questions about Tollywood movies.

> You can **Run** this program in your browser by using this [Hyperlink.](https://replit.com/@GayathriKayapat/Mark-Two#index.js?embed=1&output=1)

If you give the right answers it counts score then it gives your final score.

I used **JavaScript** to build this quiz application.
